|Source      |Identifier     |Type                 |Section |Description |Purpose
| GitHub | #11 | Administrative | Title | Title was renamed to include "tileset metadata" | Clarity
| GitHub | #1 | Substantive | 4 | Align with the Abstract specification Topic 22 - Core Tiling Conceptual and Logical Models for 2D Euclidean Space OGC 19-014r3 | Consistency
| GitHub | #13 | Substantive | 5 | OWS Common dependency removed | Interoperability
| GitHub | #12 | Substantive | 5 | Introduction of CRSType that allows for using a full WKT description as an alternative to a CRS link for a CRS definition | Interoperability
| GitHub | #34 | Critical | 6 | Identifying with `uri` a well-known TileMatrixSet in the official OGC registry | Usability
| GitHub | #5 | Critical | 6 | Replacing `topLeftCorner` by `pointOfOrigin` | Usability
| GitHub | #30 | Critical | 6 |  Renaming `supportedCRS` to `crs` | Consistency
| GitHub | #4, #5 | Substantive | 6 | Adding `cellSize` and `cornerOfOrigin` | Usability
| GitHub | #18 | Substantive | 6 | Making `boundingBox` optional | Usability
| GitHub | #18 | Substantive | 6 | Adding optional `orderedAxes` to highlight CRS axis ordering | Usability
| Editor | NA | Critical | 7 | JSON encoding rules to derive a JSON encoding from UML | Interoperability
| GitHub | #7 | Substantive | 7 | Removing `type` object properties | Consistency
| Editor | NA | Substantive | 7 | Removing the JSON-LD due lack of interest and concerns on real use cases. It can be reintroduced at later stage | Interoperability
| GitHub | #10, #11, #30 | Critical | 8 | New data model for tileset metadata that includes the TileMatrixSetLimits and replaces TileMatrixSetLink | Completeness
| GitHub | #34 | Critical | 8 | Linking to (rel: `tiling-scheme`) or embedding a TileMatrixSet definition, and identifying use of registered TileMatrixSet with `tileMatrixSetURI` | Completeness
| GitHub | #10, #11 | Substantive | 9 | New XML and JSON encoding for tileset metadata. It could be useful for the new OGC API Tiles | Completeness
| GitHub | #31 | Administrative  | Annex D, F | Axis order in the EuropeanETRS89_LAEAQuad TMS | Consistency
| GitHub | #22 | Substantive | Annex E | New annex with variable width TMS definitions | Completeness
