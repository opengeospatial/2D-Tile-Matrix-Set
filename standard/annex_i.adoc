== Pseudocode (Informative)

This informative Annex provides pseudocode that illustrates how to get the tiles that cover a bounding box rectangle and how to get the CRS coordinates that bound a tile.

[[from-bbox-to-tile-indices]]
=== From BBOX to tile indices

The following fragment of pseudocode could be used to convert from a desired bounding box (bBoxMinX, bBoxMinY, bBoxMaxX, bBoxMaxY) in CRS coordinates to a range of tile set indices. This pseudocode uses the same notation that subclause 6.1.1 uses. In this pseudocode it is assumed that bBoxMinX, bBoxMinY, bBoxMaxX, bBoxMaxY, tileMatrixMinX, tileMatrixMinY, tileMatrixMinY, tileMatrixMaxY, tileSpanX and tileSpanY are floating point variables (IEEE-754) that have accuracy issues derived from the finite precision of the representation. These accuracy issues could be amplified in a typical floor() rounding down function that could return a value ±1 than what is expected. To overcome this issue this code uses a small value (epsilon) added or subtracted in a place that is not affected by CRS coordinate precision.

[source,c]
....
// to compensate for floating point computation inaccuracies
epsilon = 1e-6

tileMinCol = floor((bBoxMinX - tileMatrixMinX) / tileSpanX + epsilon)
tileMaxCol = floor((bBoxMaxX - tileMatrixMinX) / tileSpanX - epsilon)
tileMinRow = floor((tileMatrixMaxY - bBoxMaxY) / tileSpanY + epsilon)
tileMaxRow = floor((tileMatrixMaxY - bBoxMinY) / tileSpanY - epsilon)

// to avoid requesting out-of-range tiles
if (tileMinCol < 0) tileMinCol = 0
if (tileMaxCol >= matrixWidth) tileMaxCol = matrixWidth-1
if (tileMinRow < 0) tileMinRow = 0
if (tileMaxRow >= matrixHeight) tileMaxRow = matrixHeight-1
....

 

To fetch all the tiles that cover this bounding box, a client would scan through tileMinCol to tileMaxCol and tileMinRow to tileMaxRow, all inclusive. A total of (tileMaxCol- tileMinCol+1) × (tileMaxRow- tileMinRow+1) will be fetched.

[[from-tile-indices-to-bbox]]
=== From tile indices to BBOX


The following pseudocode could be used to convert from a pair of tile indices (tileCol, tileRow) to the bounding box (in CRS coordinates) of this tile defined by the upper-left corner (leftX, upperY) of the tile:

[source,c]
....
leftX = tileCol * tileSpanX + tileMatrixMinX
upperY = tileMatrixMaxY - tileRow * tileSpanY

and the lower-right corner (rightX, lowerY) of the tile:
rightX = (tileCol+1) * tileSpanX + tileMatrixMinX
lowerY = tileMatrixMaxY – (tileRow+1) * tileSpanY
....
