[[tms-json-encoding]]
=== JSON encoding

The JSON encoding has been done respecting the naming and types of the original classes. However, there are some differences.  <<class-attributes-JSON-element-quivalences>> describes some exceptions in the mapping between the class attributes and corresponding JSON element.

[#class-attributes-JSON-element-quivalences,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.propertiesSchema attributes and JSON Schema properties equivalences
[width = "100%",options="header"]
|===
| Class attribute | JSON element | Reason
| identifier | id | Following common practice in GeoJSON and JSON-LD.
| BoundingBox class | array of 4 numbers representing lowerLeft and topRight coordinates | Following GeoJSON suggested encoding.
| LanguageString | string | JSON files are generally used in the OGC API as monolingual documents. The language of the document is determined by the HTTP language negotiation headers.
| keyworks | string array | JSON files are general used in the OGC API as monolingual documents. JSON does not use namespaces or codespaces. |
| WKT | object | The WKT encoding for JSON is an object representing a JSON encoding of the WKT defined by https://proj.org/specifications/projjson.html |
|===

In addition, all elements with multiplicity greater than one changes names to plural. Please be aware of irregular plurals such as `tileMatrix` that changes to `tileMatrices`.

[[jsontilematrixset]]
==== JSON TileMatrixSet

NOTE: A TileMatrixSet description can be embedded in other file formats, such as a Service Metadata document of a WMTS service. In this case, the media type of the containing document prevails.

An annex provides <<annex-example-encodings-for-common-tilematrixset-informative>> in JSON.

[[tms-xml-encoding]]
=== XML encoding
The XML encoding has been done respecting the naming and types of the original classes. However all attribute names have been transformed to UpperCamelCase.
