=== Overview

[[tile-matrix-set-limits-overview]]
==== TileMatrixSet limits

If the tile matrix set for a dataset covering a bounding box defines the extreme corner adjusted to the actual content of this dataset, and later the bounding box needs to be extended, then the extreme corner of each TileMatrix will change, which will change the tile indices of any previous tile invalidating any previously cached tile. To overcome this problem, a dataset can optionally use a more generic TileMatrixSet that covers a bigger (or even global) area. In fact, that TileMatrixSet that defines an area that might be covered by the dataset in a future could easily be shared for many datasets and become a common TileMatrixSet.

To inform the client about the valid range of tile indices, the TileMatrixSetLimits concept is introduced. A list of TileMatrixSetLimit informs the minimum and a maximum limits of these indices for each TileMatrix that contains actual data. The area outside these limits is considered empty space.

==== TileSet metadata

Tiles are identified by tileMatrix id, tileRow number and tileCol number. These three elements only have meaning if they are associated to a tileMatrixSet description that contains the necessary information (in terms of scaleDenominator, cellSize, pointOfOrigin and cornerOfOrigin) to transform the indices into coordinates in a known CRS. The main purpose of the TileSetMetadata is to  link the tileset with the tileMatrixSet description. In addition, the model contains elements describing the main characteristics of a tile set, the connection to the tileset with the original data collection and styles as well as the a recommended center point to start the navigation.

=== Requirements classes

[[tilematrixsetlimits-requirements-class]]
==== TileMatrixSetLimits requirements class

Requirements class tilematrixsetlimits establishes how to describe the limits for a tile set TileMatrixSet. It is expected that many TileMatrixSets are defined only once and reused many times. In these circumstances, the data used to create the tile set may only exist for a partial region or for a subset of scales. The array of TileMatrixSetLimits data structures allows for the declaration of a limited coverage of a tile matrix set. The identifying URI for this class is http://www.opengis.net/spec/tms/2.0/req/tilematrixsetlimits.

[[tilesetmetadata-requirements-class]]
==== TileSetMetadata requirements class

Requirements class TileSetMetadata establishes how to describe TileSet Metadata for a two-dimensional tile space. The TileSetMetadata data structure allows for a dataset declaring the use of a tile matrix set defined elsewhere and, if needed, a limited coverage for this tile matrix set, the list of geodata resources used to create the tileset and a recommended center point. Each TileSet in a dataset collection should declare the use of a tile matrix set using this data structure. The identifying URI for this class is http://www.opengis.net/spec/tms/2.0/req/tilesetmetadata

include::requirements/requirements_tilesetmetadata.adoc[]

include::requirements/tilesetmetadata/REQ_tilesetmetadata_identifier.adoc[]

NOTE: To determine if two resources or datasets use the same TileMatrixSet, compare their TileMatrixSet identifier. Alternatively, compare TileMatrixSet definitions for an equivalency (a simple calculation can be performed to verify whether or not two given tile matrices are aligned).

NOTE: If the same TileMatrixSet is externally available in more than one format, it is recommended that the format selected is the closer to the original description document format. For example if a OGC API defines tiles using JSON, it is expected to link to a JSON definition of a TileMatrixSet.
