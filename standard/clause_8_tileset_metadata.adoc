==== TileMatrixSet limits

Imagine a case where a tileset covers all the bounding box of a tile matrix set. Now, imagine that the tileset extent needs to be expanded beyond the point and corner of origin of each TileMatrix. Changing the point of origin changes the position of any tile row and tile column indices. In other words, in the new tileset, tiles that cover the same bounding box than the previous tileset receives different tile row and tile column indices. This invalidates any cached tile that the client could have stored and all client copies need to be updated. To overcome this problem, a dataset can optionally use a more generic TileMatrixSet that covers a bigger area (or even global one, such as one of defined in <<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>>). In fact, that TileMatrixSet that defines an area that might be covered by the dataset in a future could easily be shared for many datasets and become a common TileMatrixSet.

To inform the client about the valid range of tile indices in a tileset, the TileMatrixSetLimits concept is introduced. A list of TileMatrixSetLimit informs the minimum and maximum limits of these indices for each TileMatrix that contains actual data. The area outside these limits is considered empty space and is not cover by the tileset.

==== TileSet metadata

Tiles are identified by tileMatrix id, tileRow number and tileCol number. These three elements only have meaning if they are associated to a tileMatrixSet description that contains the necessary information (in terms of scaleDenominator, cellSize, pointOfOrigin and cornerOfOrigin) to transform the indices into coordinates in a known CRS. The main purpose of the TileSetMetadata is to link the tileset with the tileMatrixSet description. In addition, the model contains elements describing the main characteristics of a tile set, the connection to the tileset with the original data collection and styles as well as a recommended center point to start the navigation.

=== Requirements classes

[[tilematrixsetlimits-requirements-class]]
==== TileMatrixSetLimits requirements class

Requirements class tilematrixsetlimits establishes how to describe the limits for a tile set TileMatrixSet. It is expected that most TileMatrixSets will be defined only once and reused many times. In these circumstances, the data used to create the tile set may only exist for a partial region or for a subset of scales. The array of TileMatrixSetLimits data structures allows for the declaration of a limited coverage of a tile matrix set. The identifying URI for this class is http://www.opengis.net/spec/tms/2.0/req/tilematrixsetlimits.

[[tilesetmetadata-requirements-class]]
==== TileSetMetadata requirements class

Requirements class TileSetMetadata establishes how to describe TileSet Metadata for a two-dimensional tile space. The TileSetMetadata data structure enables a resource to declare the use of a tile matrix set defined elsewhere and, if needed, a limited extent for this tile matrix set, the list of geospatial resources used to create the tileset and a recommended center point. Each TileSet in a geospatial resource should declare the use of a tile matrix set using this data structure. The identifying URI for this class is http://www.opengis.net/spec/tms/2.0/req/tilesetmetadata

include::requirements/requirements_tilesetmetadata.adoc[]

include::requirements/tilesetmetadata/REQ_tilesetmetadata_identifier.adoc[]

NOTE: To determine if two resources or datasets use the same TileMatrixSet, compare their TileMatrixSet identifier. Alternatively, compare TileMatrixSet definitions for an equivalency (a simple calculation can be performed to verify whether or not two given tile matrices are aligned).

NOTE: If the same TileMatrixSet is externally available in more than one format, it is recommended that the format selected is the closer to the original description document format. For example, if an OGC API defines tiles using JSON, it is expected to link to a JSON definition of a TileMatrixSet.
