[[identifiers]]
=== Identifiers

The normative provisions in this Standard are denoted by the URI

http://www.opengis.net/spec/TileMatrixSet/2.0

All requirements and conformance tests that appear in this document are denoted by
partial URIs which are relative to this base URI.

[[commonClasses]]
=== Common Classes

The following classes are extracted from the <<ogc06-121r9>> OWS Common Standard. As
such, the data structures presented in this Standard become independent from OWS
Common Standard and can be used independently.

[[multilingualTextEncoding]]
==== Multilingual text encoding

Some text parameters specified with the data type CharacterString in UML are intended
to have human-readable values. However not all humans can understand the same spoken
languages. This data class is mapped to XML or JSON encodings afterwards.

The specified approach for allowing the language of a text value to be explicitly
stated is indicated by the UML class diagram in the figure.

[[fig1]]
.LanguageString UML model
image::LanguageString.png[LanguageString UML model]

The value parameter specifies the human-language string, and the lang parameter
specifies the language (in <<rfc4646>> syntax) of the string. If a lang parameter is
not present, then no language has been specified for the string unless specified by
another means.

In the case that multiple languages are necessary in a single document instance, the
element that is of the LanguageString type should be a list with one entry for each
_lang_ code.

NOTE: OGC APIs will use the language negotiation with HTTP headers. In this
situation, it is expected that elements defined as a list of LanguageString will
default into a single CharacterString that in JSON will default into a string data
type. This does not preclude that in other environments the JSON encodings for
language string can implement the LanguageString. In practice this means that a JSON
schema for a LanguageString element should support both string and language string
types.

==== Description, Title and Keywords

A basic set of data description parameters that include a human-readable title,
description, and keywords are widely used in this Standard and defined here as a UML.

keywords of the same 'type' specified in the optional 'type' element,

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
OGC APIs will use language negotiation with HTTP headers. In this situation, it is
expected that elements defined as a list of LanguageString will default into a single
CharacterString that in JSON will default into a string data type. In JSON encodings
namespaces or codespaces (optional in the model) are not considered. This results in
a simplification of the keywords in the JSON encoding to a simple array of strings.
====

==== BoundingBox

A (basic) bounding box is one type of bounding box that is used in this Standard. The
Bounding box data structure is specified in the following UML model and table.

The BoundingBox class describes a Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR) surrounding a
feature (in the broader sense), in the supported CRS.

A 2DBoundingBox is another type of bounding box. This type is simplified from the
basic BoundingBox data type for use only with the 2D geographic CRS. This is useful
for specifying the extent 2D part of tile matrix set.

A WGS84BoundingBox is another type of bounding box. This type is simplified from the
basic BoundingBox data type for use only with the 2D geographic CRS which uses the
WGS 84 geodetic datum, where longitude precedes latitude and both are recorded in
decimal degrees.

| CRSType
| Zero or one (optional)

Include unless referenced elsewhere

| orderedAxis

| Zero or one (optional)

footnote:c[The number of axes and names is specified by the referenced CRS
definition, but may also be specified here for convenience. In particular, it
makes the axis order more visible.]

|===

If the referenced CRS uses an Ellipsoidal, Spherical, Polar, or Cylindrical
coordinate system, the bounding box contents defined will not always specify the
MINIMUM rectangular BOUNDING region (as those terms are specified in OGC Abstract
Specification Topic 2). Specifically, this bounding box will not specify the minimum
rectangular bounding region surrounding a geometry in which the set of points spans
the value discontinuity in an angular coordinate axis. Such axes include the
longitude and latitude of Ellipsoidal and Spherical coordinate systems. That geometry
could lie within a small region on the surface of the ellipsoid or sphere.

Theoretically, there are cases where defining a bounding box could be problematic or
impossible, such as angular axis of an Ellipsoidal, Spherical, Polar, or Cylindrical
coordinate system. However, tiles need to be circumscribed to real coordinates and
will deliberately avoid regions of the space where coordinates go to infinite or
cannot be defined. For example, the `WorldMercatorWGS84Quad` tile matrix set (based
on a cylindrical projection) should not be used close to the poles. Since tiles are
conterminous, it is always possible to define a bounding box that includes them all.

==== CRSType

In this version of the standard, the possibility to define a CRS using a full
description in addition to a reference to an external CRS catalogue is introduced.
For backwards compatibility, CRSType still defaults to a URI but is extended to a
union of three possibilities (URI, WKT2 CRS, or <<iso19115>> MD_ReferenceSystem).

| Any

| referenceSystem

| MD_ReferenceSystem

==== WebLink

Many recent standards emphasize the usefulness of links as a way to relate a data
structure instance to other data structures and make navigation through resources
possible. Essential links are made explicit in the data structures of this document
(recognizable by a URI data type) but other links can be added as needed for
convenience when a WebLink is available. The data structure defined here allows the
addition of other links. The definition is based on the web linking defined in the
<<rfc8288>> and the XML serialization present in <<rfc4287,section=4.2.7>> and in
the JSON serialization found in this IETF draft:
https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-pot-json-link-01.html

NOTE: In practice, some encodings can opt to specify the essential links as part of
this data structure for convenience
