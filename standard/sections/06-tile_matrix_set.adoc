== TileMatrixSet

=== Overview

As stated in <<ogc18-005r5>> Abstract Specification Topic 2: Referencing by
Coordinates, a coordinate system is a set of mathematical rules for specifying how
coordinates are to be assigned to points in space. A CRS is a coordinate system that
is related to the real world by a reference datum. An example of mathematical rules
is the application of a sphere or an ellipsoid centered in the datum and the use of a
projection to transform the sphere or the ellipsoid into a planar representation of
the world. Usually, the resulting planar coordinates are expressed as real numbers
that are distances to the origin of the projection. This section introduces a tile
scheme called Tile Matrix Set that is defined on top of a CRS. A fundamental part of
the definition of a Tile Matrix Set is the Tile Matrix.

[[tile-matrix]]
==== Tile Matrix

A _Tile Matrix_ tile set defined by a tile scheme based on a regular tessellation of
a 2D planar surface that follows a regular grid coverage. For the <<ogc09-146r6>> CIS
GeneralGridCoverage, the domain set of a grid describes the direct positions in
multi-dimensional coordinate space, depending on the type of grid. In a grid-regular
coverage, simple equidistant grids are established. When a grid-regular coverage is
used to represent the world, the space becomes discrete in each dimension of the grid
_domain range_. One possible discrete subdivision is the use of multidimensional
_grid cells_. Another is to divide the domain into regular intervals that can be
assigned to integer numbers that enumerate and identify _tiles_. This grid of tiles
domain range can be defined by:

[loweralpha]
. The point of origin and corner of origin in a two-dimensional space of the bounding
box of regular grid coverage (e.g., the CRS coordinates of the top left corner of the
top left extreme where the integer coordinates are 0). This is the tile set origin
that defines where the spatial origin reference point is for the entire tile set.
. A tile size in CRS units for each dimension of the CRS; and
. The size of the tile matrix in tile units (i.e., number of tiles) that closes the
bounding box of the tiled space. Frequently the sizes of the two first dimensions are
called _matrix width_ and _matrix height_.

[[tile-matrix-in-a-two-dimensional-space]]
===== Tile matrix in a two-dimensional space.

Two main use cases can be defined for tiles: storage and visualization. When Tiles
are rendered in visualization devices that have the space quantized in pixels
characterized by a size the concept of scale emerges. Then, the tile size in CRS
units of the first two spatial dimensions and the size of the visualization device
pixels become related. The two spatial dimensions are aligned with the pixel axes of
the device.

In raster tiles, a second regular grid that is coincident with the tile matrix but
denser (with smaller cell size but an exact submultiple of that size) is defined.
Each grid cell of this new higher resolution grid is called a _grid cell_. The grid
cells are defined by equally dividing the original tiles into _grid cells_ using the
_number of rendering cells in a tile_ (_tile width_ and _tile height_). In common
tiled 2D visualization clients, a part of the _grid cell_ is made coincident with the
device pixels and this part of the grid is rendered in the device: the second grid is
named here as the _extrapolated_ _device grid_. In other words, a tile is divided in
a number of cells in each dimension of the CRS in a way that creates cells that will
become the exact same size of the pixels of a visualization device during
visualization. The relation between both sizes is a function of the following two
parameters:

[loweralpha]
. A scale (expressed as a scale denominator) and
. A grouping _of rendering pixels_ in a tile forming the tile. Common grouping values
are 256x256 or 512x512. Frequently the sizes of the two first dimensions are called
_tile width_ and _tile height_.

NOTE: Commonly _tile width_ and _tile height_ are equal but this constraint is not
imposed by this Standard.

Since services cannot predict the pixel size of the client visualization device, in
this Standard, the scale denominator is defined with respect to a "standardized
rendering pixel size" of stem:[0.28" mm" xx 0.28" mm"] (millimeters). The definition
is the same as used in Web Map Service WMS 1.3.0 <<ogc06-042>> and in the Symbology
Encoding (SE) Implementation Specification 1.1.0 <<ogc05-077r4>> that was later
adopted by WMTS 1.0 <<ogc07-057r7>>. Frequently, the true pixel size of the device is
unknown and 0.28 mm was the actual pixel size of a common display from 2005. This
value is still being used as reference, even if current display devices are built
with much smaller pixel sizes.

NOTE: Since the 1980s, the Microsoft Windows operating system has set its default
standard display pixels per inch (PPI) to 96. This value results in an approximated
stem:[0.264" mm"] per pixel. The similarity of this value with the actual stem:[0.28"
mm"] adopted in this Standard can create some confusion.

NOTE: Modern display devices (screens) have pixels so small that operating systems
allow for defining a presentation scale factor bigger than one (e.g. 150%). In these
circumstances, the actual size of the device pixels is not the same as the size used
by the operating system.

Normally the _matrix width_ is constant and, in this circumstance, having a single
scale factor using a single standardized rendering cell size for the two dimensions
results in cells that have the same size in the first two dimensions. This is
commonly known as _square pixels_.

NOTE: The geometry above is different from WMS, which does allow non-square pixels
(although many implementations fail to support non-square pixels properly).

NOTE: In rendered tiles, it is common that the range set represents colors of the
cells and is stored in PNG or JPEG files of exactly one tile. Nevertheless, nothing
prevents storing other kinds of values in other formats, such as TIFF files.

Tiled vector data also make use of the _extrapolated device grid_, where the tiles
are rendered for visualization purposes.

NOTE: Some tiled vector data expressed in formats such as GeoJSON do not make use of
an _extrapolated device grid_. Other tiled formats (e.g., MBTiles) define an internal
coincident grid denser than the _extrapolated device grid_ and express the position
using indices in this denser grid instead of coordinates.

For the case of a two-dimensional space, given the top left point of the tile matrix
in CRS coordinates (tileMatrixMinX, tileMatrixMaxY), the width and height of the tile
matrix in tile units (matrixWidth, matrixHeight), the _rendering cells in a tile_
values (tileWidth, tileHeight), the coefficient to convert the coordinate reference
system (CRS) units into meters (metersPerUnit), and the scale (1:scaleDenominator),
the bottom right corner of the bounding box of a tile matrix (tileMatrixMaxX,
tileMatrixMinY) can be calculated as follows:

stem:["cellSize" = "scaleDenominator" xx 0.28 10^{-3} // "metersPerUnit"(crs)]

stem:["tileSpanX" = "tileWidth" xx "cellSize"]

stem:["tileSpanY" = "tileHeight" xx "cellSize"]

stem:["tileMatrixMaxX" = "tileMatrixMinX" + "tileSpanX" xx "matrixWidth"]

stem:["tileMatrixMinY" = "tileMatrixMaxY" - "tileSpanY" xx "matrixHeight"]

NOTE: In a CRS with coordinates expressed in meters, stem:["metersPerUnit"(crs)]
equals 1.

NOTE: In CRS with coordinates expressed in degrees stem:["metersPerUnit"(crs)]
equals stem:[360//("EquatorialRadius"**2**"PI")] (360 degrees are equivalent to
the EquatorialPerimeter). E.g for WGS84 stem:["metersPerUnit"(crs)] is
111319.4908 meters/degree.

The tile space therefore looks like this:

[[fig5]]
.Tile Space (the corner of origin is topLeft)
image::1.png[Tile Space]

Each tile in a tile matrix is identified by its _tileCol_ and _tileRow_ indices that
have their 0,0 origin in one of the corners of the tile matrix. When the topLeft
corner is used, _tileCol_ increases towards the right and _TileRow_ towards the
bottom, as shown in <<fig5>> (bottomLeft corner can also be used as origin making
_TileRow_ increase towards the top). <<annex-pseudocode-informative>> includes
pseudocode that illustrates the process for obtaining the tile indices that cover a
bounding box rectangle and also the computation to get the CRS coordinates that bound
a tile.

NOTE: A tile matrix can be implemented as a set of image files (e.g., PNG or JPEG) in
a file folder, each file representing a single tile

NOTE: Section 6 of the TIFF specification v6 defines 2D tiles in the same way that
has been done in this standard. All tiles in a tile matrix can be stored in a single
TIFF file. The TIFF file includes only one set conterminous tiles sharing a common
single scale.

[[tile-matrix-set]]
==== Tile Matrix Set

Depending on the range of scales needed to be represented in the screen of a client,
a single tile matrix is impractical and might force the software to spend too much
time simplifying/generalizing the dataset prior to rendering.

Commonly, several tile matrices are progressively defined covering the expected
ranges of scales needed for the application. A _Tile Matrix Set_ is a tile scheme
composed of a collection of tile matrices, optimized for a particular scale and
identified by a tile matrix identifier. Each Tile Matrix Set has an optional
approximated bounding box, but each tile matrix has an exact bounding box that is
deduced indirectly from other parameters. Tile matrix bounding boxes at each scale
will usually vary slightly due to their cell alignment.

[[fig6]]
.Tile Matrix Set representation
image::2.png[Tile Matrix Set representation]

A Tile Matrix has a unique alphanumeric identifier in the Tile Matrix Set. Some
tile-based implementations prefer to use a _zoom level_ number or level of detail
designation (LoD)  which has the advantage of suggesting some order in the list of
tile matrices. This Standard does not use the _zoom level_ concept but, to ease
adoption of this standard in implementations that prefer numeric zoom levels, many
Tile Matrix Sets defined in <<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>>
use numbers as Tile Matrix identifiers. In this case, the index order in the list of
tile matrices defined in a Tile Matrix Set could still be used as a _zoom level
ordering_ internally.

In some other standards, the tile matrix set concept is called an _image pyramid,_
like in clause 11.6 of the OGC KML 2.2 <<ogc07-147r2>> standard.  JPEG2000
(<<iso15444-1>>) and JPIP (<<iso15444-9>>) also use a similar division of the space
called _resolution levels_. Nevertheless, in those cases the pyramid is self-defined
starting from the more detailed tile matrix (that uses square tiles), and
constructing tiles of the next scales by successively aggregating 4 tiles of the
previous scale, and so on (see <<fig6>>), and interpolating each 4 contiguous values
of the previous scale into one in the next scale. That approach involves a more rigid
structure which has scales related by powers of two and tiles that perfectly overlap
tiles on the inferior scale denominators. Tile Matrix Sets presented in this document
are more flexible, but KML _superoverlays_ or JPEG2000-based implementations can use
this standard with some extra rules to describe their tile matrix sets. This document
describes some tile matrix sets with scale sets related by powers of two in the
<<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>>.

Each of the WMTS procedure-oriented architectural style operations and
resource-oriented architectural style resources are described in more detail in
subsequent clauses in this standard.

NOTE: Clients and servers have to be careful when comparing floating numbers with
tolerance (double precision, 16-digit numbers, have to be used).

[[well-known-scale-sets]]
==== Well-known scale sets

When overlaying and presenting tiles encoded in different tile matrix sets that do
not have common sets of scale denominators and the same CRS in an integrated client,
rescaling or re-projecting tiles to the common scale of the view might require
re-sampling calculations that result in visual quality degradation.

The recommended way to prevent this problem is make use of the same global tile
matrix set. For example, one of those available in
<<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>>. If the geographic extent of
the data covers only a part of the tile matrix set area, the _tile matrix limits_
element of the tileset metadata can be used to inform about these limitations.

If using the same tile matrix set is not possible, using a common CRS and a common
set of scales shared by as many layers and services as possible can also be a
solution. Thus, the concept of well-known scale set (WKSS) is introduced.

Note that a WKSS only defines a small subset of what is needed to completely define a
Tile Matrix Set. A WKSS is an optional feature that does not replace the need to
define the Tile Matrix Set and its Tile Matrices. The original purpose of WKSS is no
longer necessary if services share and reference common Tile Matrix Set definitions
such as the ones in <<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>>.

A WKSS is a commonly used combination of a CRS and a set of scales. A tile matrix set
can declare support for a WKSS set by referencing that WKSS. A client application can
confirm that tiles in one tile matrix set are compatible with tiles in another tile
matrix set merely by verifying that they declare a common WKSS. The informative
<<annex-well-known-scale-sets-informative>> provides several WKSSs (and others could
be incorporated in the future).

A tile matrix set conforms to a particular WKSS when it uses the same CRS and defines
all scale denominators ranging from some large scale denominator in the WKSS to some
low scale denominator (in other words, it is not necessary to define all the lower
scale denominators to conform to a WKSS).

[[tile-based-coordinates-in-a-tile-matrix-set]]
==== Tile based coordinates in a tile matrix set

A tile in a tile-based coordinate can be referred by its tile position in the tile
matrix dimensions and the tile matrix identifier in tile matrix set. In a
two-dimensional space, a tile is identified by these 3 discrete index names: _tile
row_, _tile column_ and _tile matrix identifier_.

In raster tiles, a grid cell in the _extrapolated_ _device grid_ domain set can be
identified by a set of floating point coordinates in the CRS and by one of two ways
that does not present rounding issues, as follows.

[loweralpha]
. By the tile indices the grid cell is contained by (referred by its tile position in
the tile matrix dimensions and the Tile Matrix identifier in the Tile Matrix Set) and
the cell indices inside the tile (stem:[i,j,...]). In a two-dimensional space, a cell
is identified by 5 discrete indices that are named: _tile row_, _tile column_, _tile
matrix identifier_, stem:[i] and stem:[j]. This is how GetFeatureInfo works in WMTS.
This set of coordinates is called "_tile_ coordinates."
. By the position of the cell in grid defined by the _extrapolated_ _device grid_
domain set (that starts at the top left corner of the tiled space) of the tile matrix
and the identifier of the Tile Matrix in Tile Matrix Set. In a two-dimensional space,
a grid cell is identified by 3 discrete indices that are named: stem:[i'], stem:[j']
and _tile matrix identifier_. Note that stem:[i'] and stem:[j'] can be very big
integer numbers and, for very detailed scale, tile matrices might require integer
64-bit notation if stored as binary numbers. This set of indices is called
"_tilematrix_ coordinates."

[[variable-matrixwidth-tile-matrix]]
==== Variable width tile matrices

Until now, it has been assumed that _matrixWidth_ is constant for all tile rows. This
is common usage for projections that do not distort the Earth too much. But when
using Equirectangular Plate Carrée projection (see
<<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>> subsection 2) the distortion
increases for tiles closer to the poles. In the extreme, the upper row of the upper
tile (the one representing the North Pole) contains a list of repeated values that
represents almost the same position in the space. The same can be said for the lower
row of the lower tile (the one representing the South Pole). When the tiles are
represented in a flat projection, this is an effect that cannot be avoided, but when
the data are presented in a virtual globe, the distortion results in redundant
information in the poles that need to be eliminated by the client during the
rendering. Compensating for distortion is better done at the server side instead.

The solution consists of reducing the number of tiles (_matrixWidth_) in the high
latitude rows and generating those tiles with a compressed scale in the longitudinal
dimension (see <<fig8>>). To allow this solution, the tile model must be extended to
specify coalescence coefficients (stem:[c]) that reduce the number of tiles in the
width direction by aggregating stem:[c] horizontal tiles but keeping the _tileWidth_
(and _tileHeight_). The coalescence coefficient is not applied next to the Equator
but is used in medium and high latitudes (the higher the latitude the larger the
coefficient).

Even if tiles can coalesce, this does not change the indexing or the tile matrix set
that will be the same as if no coalescence has been applied. For example, if the
stem:[c] coefficient is 4, the _tileCol_ of the first tile will be 0, the _tileCol_
of the second tile will be 4, the _tileCol_ of the third tile will be 8 and so on. In
other words, and for the same example, _tileCol_ 0, 1, 2 and 3 points to the same tile.

NOTE: This solution is necessary to still be able to define a rectangle in the space
based on tile indices as we do in the <<tilematrixsetlimits-requirements-class>>.

==== TileMatrixSet requirements class

Requirements class tilematrixset establishes how to describe a TileMatrixSet for a
two-dimensional tile space. The expectation is that tile matrix sets are defined once
and that servers or encodings using or distributing tiles will declare the usage of a
tile matrix set by linking to that tile matrix set.

[[TileMatrixSetCRSCompatibility]]
===== TileMatrixSet CRS Compatibility

In general, the CRS of the TileSets using a TileMatrixSet should be the same as the
CRS of that TileMatrixSet. However, there are some situations where there is some
flexibility:

* The CRS of the TileSet is a realization of the datum ensemble CRS specified in the
TileMatrixSet. E.g. TileSet CRS: EPSG:9057 (G1762 realization of WGS84) and
TileMatrixSet CRS: EPSG:4326 (WGS84)
* The CRS of the TileSet includes additional dimensions beyond the 2 specified in the
CRS of the TileMatrixSet. E.g. TileSet CRS: EPSG:4979 (lat, lon, h in WGS84) and
TileMatrixSet CRS: EPSG:4326 (lat, lon in WGS84)
* The CRS of the TileSet and the CRS of the TileMatrixSet only differ in axes
ordering. E.g. TileSet CRS: EPSG:4326 (lat, lon) and TileMatrixSet CRS: CRS84 (lon,
lat). The order specified in the TileMatrixSet only affects the coordinates order for
the PointOfOrigin and optional BoundingBox within the TileMatrixSet definition
itself. The CRS of the TileSet affects the coordinates order for the data in the
tiles, if applicable (e.g some formats of vector tiles)
