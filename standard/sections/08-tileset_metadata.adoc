== TileSetMetadata

=== Overview

[[tileset-medatadata-overview]]
==== TileSet metadata

Tiles are identified by tileMatrix id, tileRow number and tileCol number. These three
elements only have meaning if they are associated with a TileMatrixSet description that
contains the necessary information (in terms of scaleDenominator, cellSize,
pointOfOrigin and cornerOfOrigin) to transform the indices into coordinates in a
known CRS. The main purpose of the TileSetMetadata is to link the TileSet with the
TileMatrixSet description. In addition, the model contains elements describing the
main characteristics of a TileSet, preserving the connection from the TileSet to the original
data collection and styles as well as a recommended center point to start the
navigation.

[[tile-matrix-set-limits-overview]]
==== TileMatrixSet limits

Imagine a case where a tileset covers the whole bounding box of a tile matrix
set. Now, imagine that the tileset extent needs to be expanded beyond the point
and corner of origin of each TileMatrix. Changing the point of origin changes
the position of any tile row and tile column indices. In other words, in the new
tileset, tiles that cover the same bounding box as the previous tileset
receive different tile row and tile column indices. This invalidates any cached
tiles that the client could have stored and all client copies need to be
updated. To overcome this problem, a dataset can optionally use a more generic
TileMatrixSet that covers a bigger area (or even the entire globe, such as one of
those defined in <<annex-common-tilematrixset-definitions-informative>>). In fact,
that TileMatrixSet defining an area that might be covered by the dataset in
the future could easily be re-used for many other datasets and become a common
TileMatrixSet.

To inform the client about the valid range of tile indices in a tileset, the
TileMatrixSetLimits concept is introduced. A list of TileMatrixSetLimits informs
the minimum and maximum limits of these indices for each TileMatrix that
contains actual data. The area outside these limits is considered empty space
and is not covered by the tileset.

=== Requirements classes

==== TileMatrixSetLimits requirements class

Requirements class TileMatrixSetLimits establishes how to describe the limits for a
TileSet in the TileMatrixSet. It is expected that most TileMatrixSets will be defined
only once and reused many times. In these circumstances, the data used to create the
TileSet may only exist for a partial region or for a subset of scales. The array of
TileMatrixSetLimits data structures allows for the declaration of a limited coverage
of a TileMatrixSet. The identifying URI for this class is
http://www.opengis.net/spec/tms/2.0/req/tilematrixsetlimits.

==== TileSetMetadata requirements class

Requirements class TileSetMetadata establishes how to describe TileSet Metadata for a
two-dimensional tile space. The TileSetMetadata data structure enables a resource to
declare the use of a tile matrix set defined elsewhere and, if needed, a limited
extent for this tile matrix set, the list of geospatial resources used to create the
tileset and a recommended center point. Each TileSet in a geospatial resource should
declare the use of a tile matrix set using this data structure. The identifying URI
for this class is http://www.opengis.net/spec/tms/2.0/req/tilesetmetadata

include::../requirements/requirements_tilesetmetadata.adoc[]

include::../requirements/tilesetmetadata/REQ_tilesetmetadata_identifier.adoc[]

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
The `tileMatrixSet` property with an object describing the TileMatrixSet is not
intended for OGC APIs or OGC web services and it is included here for offline formats
and encodings where links to resources are not possible or sensible.
====

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
To determine if two resources or datasets use the same TileMatrixSet, compare their
TileMatrixSet identifier. Alternatively, compare TileMatrixSet definitions for an
equivalency (a simple calculation can be performed to verify whether or not two given
tile matrices are aligned).
====

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
If the same TileMatrixSet is externally available in more than one format, it is
recommended that the format selected is the closer to the original description
document format. For example, if an OGC API defines tiles using JSON, it is expected
to link to a JSON definition of a TileMatrixSet.
